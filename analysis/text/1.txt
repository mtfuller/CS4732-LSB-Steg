Stegosaurus is a genus of thyreophoran dinosaur. Fossils of this genus date
to the Late Jurassic period, where they are found in Kimmeridgian to early
Tithonian aged strata, between 155 and 150 million years ago, in the western
United States and Portugal. Several species have been classified in the upper
Morrison Formation of the western U.S, though only three are universally
recognized; S. stenops, S. ungulatus and S. sulcatus. The remains of over 80
individual animals of this genus have been found. Stegosaurus would have
lived alongside dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus,
Allosaurus, and Ceratosaurus; the latter two may have been predators of it.
